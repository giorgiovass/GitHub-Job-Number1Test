Hello! How are you doing? Please translate this text below, it is about the concept known as "jerk" in Jamaican cuisine. Thanks!

Over a jerk daiquiri (white rum, thyme, allspice, and habanero) and some patties at chef Paul Carmichael’s newly opened Caribbean restaurant Bar Kabawa in Manhattan, I asked Mitchell about what she thinks about jerk becoming such a popular buzzword for cultural mash-ups and viral menu items.

“I hate the idea that it needs to have this cultural movement, but I suppose for me, it just doesn’t feel as if Caribbean food has had time to really be embedded and infiltrated,” she says. “Jerk definitely is the thing, I suppose, that is penetrating, but I can find it frustrating that it’s become this kind of homogenized package, and it feels like the only thing that exists in terms of the lexicon of Caribbean food.”


At the festival, I ate jerk pig tails from Vell Monkey Foot, jerk chicken gyro from Tropical Gyros, jerk grouper siu mai from the Poop Deck, and jerk prawn spring rolls from Kitchen Culture—all local restaurants and catering businesses in Nassau. The only jerk I turned down over the course of the weekend was the jerk chicken sandwich from the Quiznos at the Nassau airport, which advertised toppings like mozzarella, lettuce, mayo, and barbecue sauce.

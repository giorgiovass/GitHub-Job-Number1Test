Hello! How are you doing? Please translate this text below, it is about the concept known as "jerk" in Jamaican cuisine. Thanks!

Turn your TV into a slideshow or media player

Most new TV models come with a pair of USB 2.0 ports, and often a 3.0 port for faster data transfer. Your TV screen is likely bigger than your computer monitor, so why not use it to carousel a gallery of images or play videos? 

I attended a family gathering recently, and the host used a 65-inch TV to do that very thing. The scanned pictures and videos looked and sounded great -- all accessed by simply plugging in a USB flash drive. 

Just about any type of external hard drive, thumb drive, or data stick will function as if you plugged it into a laptop. Your TV will immediately recognize a connected device and offer you a means for accessing and navigating your media files.

Cornmeal: Choose a fine or medium grind of stone-ground cornmeal (white or yellow, both work well) instead of machine-milled meal. Mass-produced cornmeal lends a gritty, sandy texture to the cornmeal. With an ingredient list this short, using quality cornmeal is of utmost importance. If you canâ€™t find stone-ground cornmeal in your grocery store, order it from a reputable source like Logan Turnpike, Anson Mills, or Palmetto Farms.

One final line of text goes here, but now I need to add one more line of text here to trigger the update.

Hyperautomation is good, hopefully I can break this orchestrator workflow!

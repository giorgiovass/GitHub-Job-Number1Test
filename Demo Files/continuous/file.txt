Over a jerk daiquiri (white rum, thyme, allspice, and habanero) and some patties at chef Paul Carmichael’s newly opened Caribbean restaurant Bar Kabawa in Manhattan, I asked Mitchell about what she thinks about jerk becoming such a popular buzzword for cultural mash-ups and viral menu items.

“I hate the idea that it needs to have this cultural movement, but I suppose for me, it just doesn’t feel as if Caribbean food has had time to really be embedded and infiltrated,” she says. “Jerk definitely is the thing, I suppose, that is penetrating, but I can find it frustrating that it’s become this kind of homogenized package, and it feels like the only thing that exists in terms of the lexicon of Caribbean food.”

Hi!

This is an updated version of a file that will be translated. This will now be version 4.

Thanks, and best regards!

The below is an introduction to the "Bloomin' Onion" from Outback Steakhouse. Please read on:

When Ryan Nanni put on the singularly iconic — and utterly ridiculous — Bloomin’ Onion costume for the 2018 Outback Bowl, all he could think about was how uncomfortable he was and how utterly absurd the journey had been up until this point.

In the last year or so, I’ve walked by snaking lines for jerk pizza, stood in a queue for a sold-out jerk chicken salad sandwich on coco bread from a popup by baker Bryan Ford, and watched viral videos of the rapper Rubi Rose assisting in the construction of a bodega jerk chopped cheese. It’s all made me wonder: What can’t jerk do? And how did this specific set of flavors become such a common cultural shorthand for Caribbean cuisine?

“While it’s specifically Jamaican,” Mitchell writes, “jerk is an incredible example of the complexity and ingenuity of Caribbean cuisine in general, and of how the food is so richly expressive of the people.”

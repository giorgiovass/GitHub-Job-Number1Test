Material listed in Rambi is compiled from thousands of periodicals and from collections of articles - in Hebrew, Yiddish, and European languages - mainly from the holdings of the Jewish National and University Library, a world center for research on the Jewish people and Eretz Israel. The main criterion for inclusion in the bibliography is that the article be based on scientific research, or contain important information for such research. Since the inception of this bibliographic project in 1966, the editorial board has striven to include in it all of the important articles published throughout the world in the field of Judaica. Therefore, it includes offprints of articles from journals or collections not on order to the Library. Rambi also lists articles from secondary sources.</shortDescription>

        <shortDescription>Physical Review Focus is a free service of the American Physical Society (APS). Focus stories explain selected physics research published in the APS journals Physical Review (PR) and Physical Review Letters (PRL). Selection Criteria Since the main goal of the service is to communicate current research beyond the bounds of a physics sub-discipline, the selection criteria for Focus differ from those of a research journal. Papers will often be chosen based on educational value and intrinsic interest to non-specialists, rather than simply on scientific merit. Research that is well-covered by other sources may also be passed over in favor of less-publicized work. Journal Articles Our link from each story to the relevant APS journal article uses the APS URL formula including DOI (details) and takes readers to the free abstract page of the paper. Subscribers to the online journals can access the full text from there (subscription information). Journalists and other science writers may receive a copy of any paper published, or to be published, in Physical Review or Physical Review Letters.</shortDescription>

With clinically-organized summaries for more than 3,000 topics, DynaMed is the only evidence-based reference shown to answer most clinical questions during practice. Based on the results of a study published in Annals of Family Medicine (November/December 2005), not only did primary care clinicians answer more clinical questions with access to DynaMed than without DynaMed, but these clinicians also found more answers in DynaMed that changed clinical decisions. DynaMed is updated daily and monitors the content of over 500 medical journals and systematic evidence review databases directly and indirectly by using many journal review services. Each publication is reviewed cover-to-cover, and each article is evaluated for clinical relevance and scientific validity. The new evidence is then integrated with existing content, and overall conclusions are changed as appropriate representing a synthesis of the best available evidence. Through this process of systematic literature surveillance, the best available evidence determines the content of DynaMed.</shortDescription>

The Irish Times site moved from ireland.com to irishtimes.com following the successful integration of the print and online newsrooms in early 2008. At the same time, the online subscription model, in place since 2002, was removed and replaced by a commercial model that is based on advertising. These initiatives were part of a significant development and investment program in both print and online to broaden appeal to new audiences and to be more accessible to all readers. This continues our commitment to develop the newspaper in line with its honorable history of 150 years in print and 15 years online.</shortDescription>

        <caption>Medical Letter</caption>
        <shortDescription>The Medical Letter on Drugs and Therapeutics is an independent, peer-reviewed, nonprofit publication that offers unbiased critical evaluations of drugs, with special emphasis on new drugs, to physicians and other members of the health professions. It evaluates virtually all new drugs and reviews older drugs when important new information becomes available on their usefulness or adverse effects. Published every other week in a four-page newsletter format, it carries no advertising and is supported entirely by subscription fees. A typical issue appraises two or three new drugs in terms of their effectiveness, toxicity, cost and possible alternatives. Occasionally, The Medical Letter publishes an article on a new non-drug treatment or a new diagnostic aid. The Medical Letter is intended specifically to meet the needs of the busy healthcare professional who wants unbiased, reliable and timely information on new drugs. Many of these professionals are aware that manufacturers and their representatives may exaggerate the therapeutic effects and understate the adverse effects of drugs, but have neither the time nor the resources to check the accuracy of the manufacturers' claims. If a new drug offers genuine advantages over older drugs, The Medical Letter says so. If it offers no advantage, if its effectiveness is limited, or if it is too toxic or too expensive to justify its use, The Medical Letter says so plainly.</shortDescription>

Since the first issue in 1837, The Sun has experienced dramatic growth and change that can be measured in terms of traditions, innovations, and accomplishments. From the very beginning, the Baltimore Sun Company has been devoted to Arunah Abell's belief in presenting the news that matters the most to local citizens. The lead story in the first issue of The Sun dealt with actions of the Baltimore City Council, which affected the lives of Baltimore's residents. Today, that same emphasis on what is taking place in Baltimore, its surrounding counties, and throughout Maryland makes The Sun's local news coverage among the most complete in the country.</shortDescription>

        <shortDescription>19th Century British Pamphlets - https://about.jstor.org/whats-in-jstor/primary-sources/19th-century-british-pamphlets/ "This collection, created by RLUK (Research Libraries UK), contains the most significant British pamphlets from the 19th century held in UK research libraries. Pamphlets were an important means of public debate, covering the key political, social, technological, and environmental issues of their day. They have been underutilized within research and teaching because they are generally quite difficult to access, often bound together in large numbers or otherwise hard to find in the few research libraries that hold them. The digitization of more than 20,000 pamphlets from seven UK institutions will provide researchers, students, and teachers with an immensely rich and coherent corpus of primary sources with which to study the socio-political and economic landscape of 19th century Britain. This collection was created with funding from the JISC Digitisation Programme.

        <caption>SERIUNAM</caption>
        <shortDescription>Since 1991, in the libraries of the Geography and Geology institutes, the need arose for a means of retrieving cartographic information. This situation was brought to the attention of the DGB, who supported the proposal and resolved to design a database of cartographic materials. In April 1992, activities began to develop the project, which was formalized with the signing of an agreement on December 14 of the same year, in which the institutes undertook to catalog their own cartographic material and the DGB undertook to design the database and capture the information. Initially, the database was called MAPAUNAM because it was integrated only by UNAM agencies. By 1993, its promotion and dissemination at the national level allowed the participation of other map libraries in the project and, therefore, its coverage and objectives were to be expanded. With the incorporation of other map libraries of the UNAM, as well as information from map collections of universities and institutions of higher education in the country (IES), it was decided to change the name to MAPAMEX in 1997.</shortDescription>

It currently has more than 14,000 records and approximately 71,000 copies of maps, corresponding to fourteen map libraries: Seven of them from UNAM and seven from external institutions. Its thematic diversity includes topographic, geological, edaphological, population and historical, tectonic, lithological, hydrological, seismic, hypsometric, meteorological, climatic, economic, cultural, architectural maps, in printed and electronic format, photomaps and spatial maps. At present, about 600 digitized images are available to records of the Institute of Geography, the Joint Library of Earth Sciences and Mapoteca M. Orozco y Berra (SAGARPA). The catalogographic description of the cartographic material is based on the Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules (AACR2) and the MARC21 format. To share resources and facilitate map retrieval, MAPAMEX includes the Directory of Participating Libraries. The following participate in the database:</shortDescription>

CARLI deploys the VuFind discovery interface for the I-Share library catalog(s). JJC classifies its collection using the Dewey cutting system and contains over 60,000 unique items. These items include monographs, journals/periodicals, playaways, DVD/CDs, some ebooks, and materials from Overdrive (streaming films) etc. We have just completed a weeding project and have started to catalog our print journals/periodicals. During this project we determined that a clean-up of our MARC is needed for our catalog to be more consistent. We are in the process of adding MARC records for our electronic journals, but this project is in its infancy.</shortDescription>

The USPTO makes patent grants and patent applications freely available to search and view FT both on their own site (http://patft.uspto.gov/) and on Google Patents (http://www.google.com/?tbm=pts&amp;hl=en). Explanation of terms (from http://www.google.com/googlepatents/help.html) U.S. Patent Number: The patent office assigns a unique number to each patent. For applications, the application number is preceded by “US Pat. App”. Filing Date: The filing date is the date on which the patent application was filed with the USPTO. Issue Date: The issue date is the date on which the patent was granted by the USPTO. Only patent grants have an issue date. Assignee Name: The assignee is the person or organization to which the rights of the patent are assigned. Patent Snippet: We include a snippet of text from the patent to show where the specific search terms were found. Date Restrict: We offer two ways to search for patents in a particular date range: filing date and issue date. Patent Applications: We offer you the option to limit search results to only issued patents or applications. Applications have “US Pat. App” before their application number in search results. Patent Type: Most US patents are “Utility” patents. Patents of other types have letters at the beginning of their patent numbers, described here: www.uspto.gov/patft/help/contents.htm. Because we infer the patent type from the grant number, we only search granted patents when you specify a type.</shortDescription>

        <caption>Agricultural Periodicals from the Southern, Midwestern, and Western U.S., 1800-1878</caption>
        <shortDescription>The Agricultural Periodicals from the Southern, Midwestern, and Western U.S., 1800-1878 focuses on agriculture during the 19th century. As most Americans still lived on farms and agriculture was the country's leading industry throughout the century, literature about agricultural development -- from raising crops and keeping bees to caring for livestock and erecting farm structures -- was extremely important. These magazines contain rich content, including advertisements for fertilizer dealers and makers of farm equipment, recipes and advice for farm women, instructions for performing one's own medical and veterinary treatments, records of the latest technological and agricultural developments, reports from agricultural fairs, and more. Not surprisingly, regional periodicals were especially popular, adapted to the particular climates and soil conditions of the area. This collection contains periodicals published in the West, Midwest, and South; representative titles are: Oregon Cultivator, the Southern Ruralist and Horticultural Intelligencer, the Georgia Grange, the Nebraska Farmer, the Rural Carolinian, the North Western Prairie Farmer, the Ohio Valley Farmer, the Cherokee Agriculturist, the Colorado Farmer and Live Stock Journal, the Spirit of Arkansas, the Farmers' Journal, Transactions of the Lower Canada Board of Agriculture, and the California Horticulturist and Floral Magazine.</shortDescription>

        <shortDescription>The Women's Periodicals of the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries, 1733-1844 comprises of one of three collections containing women's-related periodicals that span the 18th through the 19th century and represent a broad range of subjects and places of publication. This series draws heavily from the Colonial through the Jacksonian Era, spanning roughly from the 1730's-1840's. Because almost all of the women's periodicals by nature covered many topics, the titles included in this collection highlight radically changing perceptions of womanhood and ideas about the role of women over time. Some representative titles are: the Lady's Monthly Museum or Polite Repository of Amusement and Instruction, the Ladies' Companion, the Lady's Book, and Margret Fuller's Transcendentalist publication, the Dial.</shortDescription>

        <caption>American Literary Periodicals, 1782-1834</caption>
        <shortDescription>The American Literary Periodicals, 1782-1834 collection encapsulates the higher forms of literature and literary criticism. The work of many notable writers can be found here, including early pieces by Washington Irving and Charles Brockden Brown, among others. These periodicals and the authors who contributed to them catalyzed the beginning of distinctly American literary movements that marked a sharp break from European literary traditions. Within these pages, researchers will find rich material that not only provides insight into a developing literary canon but a radically changing American society as a whole. Representative titles include the Knickerbocker, the New York Magazine or Literary Repository, and the Monthly Anthology and Boston Review. Additionally, a few reprints of European titles are included to give scholars both a broader context and a perspective on residual European influences. These particular titles include New York editions of the Edinburgh Review or Critical Journal and the Quarterly Review.</shortDescription>

        <shortDescription>The Agricultural Periodicals from the Northeastern U.S. 1789-1879 collection focuses on publications about farming-related activities in the 19th century. Because most Americans still lived on farms, and because agriculture remained the country's leading industry throughout the century, literature about agricultural development -- from raising crops and keeping bees to caring for livestock and erecting farm structures -- was extremely important. These publications contain rich content, including architectural plans for farmhouses and outbuildings, advertisements for fertilizer dealers and makers of farm equipment, recipes and advice for farm women, instructions for performing one's own medical and veterinary treatments, records of the latest technological and agricultural developments, reports from agricultural fairs, and more. Not surprisingly, regional periodicals were especially popular, adapted to the particular climates and soil conditions of the area. This collection contains periodicals published along the east coast and New England; representative titles are: the New York Farmer and Horticultural Repository, the Vermont Cultivator, the Northern Farmer, the Philadelphia Florist, and the Maine Farmer.</shortDescription>

        <shortDescription>*The Publishing Company The Società editrice il Mulino was formed in June 1954 at the initiative of the promoter group of the journal "il Mulino", which had begun publication in Bologna in 1951. Since its inception, the goal of the Publisher was to contribute to the development and modernisation of the Italian culture, through a publications program which drew significantly from social sciences of Anglo-Saxon, and that array was inspired to an explicitly reformist and empirical approach. This purpose has never failed, and has been pursued as part of a gradually increasing variety of subject areas (history, philosophy, linguistics, literary criticism, anthropology, psychology, sociology, political science, economics, law). Windmill publications include an extensive catalog of journals, covering the full range of interests of the Publisher, and a rich production of books clearly differentiated profile. Some of the programs it is publishing textbooks and research, addressed in particular to the community of scholars. Another important editorial director identifies itself in the volumes of instrumental character, destined to the study and university education. Also in recent years have grown particularly necklaces for the non-specialist public, through which research and innovative cultural acquisitions and current are directed to public discussion, and that helped inform the mill as one of the most active editors of culture in our country. The Società editrice il Mulino is a limited company whose capital is majority controlled by the Association of culture and politics, "the mill", a non-profit organization formed in 1965 by the Group of editors of the journal "il Mulino" to organize the institutional group.</shortDescription>

        <shortDescription>We have a small physical holdings collection of around 5,000 items - most of these are print texts, though included are a hundred or so films and some AV equipment that we house for the college. Our ILS is L4U, a company operating out of Kelowna. Most of our cataloging is done through copying from AMICUS and LOC, though we do some original cataloging as well. Other texts we catalog through L4U's CheckMARC software, and these tend to include images of the texts (though they're not always accurate). Many of our records do not have thorough enough subject fields, making catalog searching difficult for users unfamiliar with the exact names of the texts that they're looking for. This is something that we're looking to rectify in the near future. Holdings are housed in three different locations, being our Vancouver Campus, our Burnaby Campus and our High School. Our database subscriptions are predominantly EBSCO hosted, and we have subscribed in this way because we currently do not have a discovery layer and any attempts at adding new, non-EBSCO hosted products have resulted in under-use of the resources.</shortDescription>

        <shortDescription>The American Political and Social Movements Periodicals, 1815-1884 collection chronicles the prevailing social, religious, political, and benevolent movements of the day. Represented here are the publications of, among others, the anarchists (the Periodical Letter) and the communists (Oneida Circular, the Rational Review, and the Communist). In addition, periodicals published by those espousing rights for workingmen are included (such as the Voice of Labor, the Reformer, or Advocate of Industrial Association, Workingman's Advocate, and the Radical), in addition to publications for immigrants (the Irish Volunteer, the Jewish Times, Der Arbeiter, the People's Friend, the Impartial Examiner and Advocate of Civil and Religious Liberty), and for "native" Americans (the Republican, the Anti-Romanist). Also to be found here are periodicals pertaining to various social movements from early women's rights periodicals (the Women's Journal, the Revolution) to periodicals promoting language reform and phonetics. Together, they tell the story of American society and politics from diverse perspectives, giving voice to the established and powerful as well as to the disenfranchised and subversive.</shortDescription>

Notables authors include Mark Twain and Walt Whitman as they published in the definitive literary periodicals of their age such as Lippincott's Magazine, the Galaxy, the Ladies Repository, and Littell's Living Age.

        <shortDescription>The Congregational, Presbyterian, and Reformed Church Periodicals, 1803-1902 collection contains periodicals giving insight into the distinct Protestant ecclesial communities that thrived in America through their participation in the activities of Congregational, Presbyterian, and Reformed churches. Congregationalism spoke easily to a people with ardent democratic aspirations, and profoundly influenced the culture and government of the new nation. The Presbyterian and Reformed churches gave expression, in different ways, to the theology of John Calvin, and flourished with their emphases on ordered worship and theological and doctrinal rigor. This collection features a range of periodicals devoted to Congregationalism, including the long-running journal the Presbyterian, the influential Congregational Sunday school periodical the Well Spring, and the Reformed theological journal the Mercersburg Review.</shortDescription>

        <caption>Hobbies, Socialization, and Sport Periodicals, 1775-1889</caption>
        <shortDescription>The Hobbies, Socialization, and Sport Periodicals, 1775-1889 collection captures the many things nineteenth-century Americans did in their spare time, and includes periodicals dedicated to fairs and bazaars, public lectures, sporting events, hobbies, and more. Although they worked extremely hard, Americans nevertheless found time for leisure activities. They printed small periodicals using their own hand-operated presses. They traveled more extensively, especially after the expansion of railroad networks and steamboat lines. They engaged in a diverse array of pastimes, from early forms of body-building to pigeon racing and stamp collecting. A sampling of titles is suggestive of the rich content found in this collection: Turf Field and Farm, the Bat and Ball, the Gymnast, Mason's Coin and Stamp Collectors' Magazine, the Magic Lantern, the Dubuque Chess Journal, and the Voice of the Fair.</shortDescription>

All Christian churches engaged in forms of outreach to groups or individuals who were in need, and this outreach was often inseparable from sharing a religious message and mission. The publications in this collection include those for both foreign and domestic missions and represent outreach to many different groups that include African-Americans, Native Americans, women, the poor, immigrants, and specific ethnic groups. Subjects include slavery, home missions, hospital work, and social problems.</shortDescription>

        <shortDescription>The Literary Periodicals of New England, 1789-1878 collection represents literary periodicals published in the cities and towns of the northeast during the nineteenth century. Absent here are publications from Boston as the emphasis is on small publications from more remote places that comprised the backbone of this region. While many of these titles are relatively obscure, they paint a picture of an early, home-grown literary tradition that is starkly different from the more dominant literature found in mass-circulated publications. In addition, this collection also offers periodicals written about Yankees and their culture, most notably the titles Brother Jonathon and Yankee Notions. Ultimately, for researchers of the nineteenth century, these titles offer a rich insight into an often overlooked place of literary and artistic production.</shortDescription>

The database is currently made up of about 561,000 records and contains bibliographic registers related to new accessions and to the opening of the Athenaeum's libraries. The SIERRA automation system was implemented in 2014. Sierra, the new version of Innovative's library automation system, represents the natural technological evolution of Millennium (implemented in December 2001). The OPAC Web has been translated and customized by the SIBA Coordination of the University of Salento, with an improvement of its performance and user services. The OPAC, accessible at the index http://siba-millennium.unisalento.it, allows the user to easily retrieve the desired information, to automatically request or reserve documents of interest, to access other bibliographic services related to teaching and research activities (course reserves), other catalogs and databases Z39.50 and other electronic resources available on the Internet (databases, full-text electronic periodicals, etc.).</shortDescription>

        <caption>Global Religious Traditions, 1760-1922</caption>
        <shortDescription>Global Religious Traditions, 1760-1922 is a collection of over 1,300 titles that profile many living traditions outside of Judaism, Christianity, or Islam, as observed in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. This collection addresses theology, philosophy, practice, and history related with the following non-Abrahamic traditions: Babism, Baha'I, Buddhism, Confucianism, Hinduism, Jainism, Native American Traditions, Shinto, Sikhism, Spiritualism, Taoism, Theosophy, Yezidi religion, and Zoroastrianism. It also addresses comparative religion featuring non-Abrahamic faiths, including tribal and folk religions of Africa, Europe, South Asia, and East Asia. These volumes provide penetrating views from multiple perspectives on the living traditions of the time. In addition to Western scholarship on these traditions (primarily in English, German, and French), several faiths are covered by scholars within their own tradition, particularly in the case of Hinduism. One of the earlier titles in the collection, a French translation of the works of Confucius published in 1783, is one of several Western language translations of sacred texts. A number of sacred texts are also presented in their original languages, specifically Sanskrit, Chinese, Japanese, and Tamil. Global Religious Traditions, 1760-1922 is a rich and robust assemblage of primary source scholarship in the form of sacred texts, original works of major thinkers, such as founders of the Theosophical Society, and firsthand accounts of Westerners traveling throughout Asia, Africa, and the Americas. The collection also offers a rare look into traditions for which contemporary scholarship was scarce. An example of this is Volksglaube Und Religiöser Brauch Der Zigeuner, expounding the religious tradition of the Romani. This collection is a valuable resource for a wide range of disciplines as well as religion scholarship, as the texts encompass a spectrum of insights on history, anthropology, politics, geography and travel, African studies, and Asian studies including classical literature of Asia.</shortDescription>

        <shortDescription>The Religion and Social Change, 1723-1921 collection contains over 1,700 monographs that chronicle 19th and 20th century social change movements as they relate to religion.

        <shortDescription>The Catholic Engagements with the Modern World, 1487-1918 collection contains nearly 1,800 monographs that profile the teaching and practices of the Catholic Church in the modern era. The Protestant Reformation and later the Enlightenment proved to be major events that required the Church to shift centuries-old ways of being and doing. The collection features a broad range of subjects, including Popes and Papacy, Mary, Modernism, Catholic Counter-Reformation, the Oxford Movement, and the Vatican I ecumenical council. Following the Reformation and Counter-Reformation, Papal teaching and Marian doctrines and practices proved to be major points of contention for Protestant critics and were also significant elements of identity for Catholics. Along these lines, the collection features many papal biographies, theological studies of the papacy, treatises on Marian doctrine and piety, and criticisms of Marian doctrine and practice by non-Catholics. The collection also chronicles the Oxford Movement, which brought many members of the Church of England into the Catholic Church with the high-profile conversion of Cardinal John Henry Newman. The Enlightenment gave birth to unprecedented social change and new secular philosophies in 19th-century Europe and North America. Later in the 19th century, the Church grappled with responses to these new movements in official texts like the 1873 copy of the Syllabus of Errors and Pope Pius X's 1910 Encyclical on Modernism (Pascendi Dominici Gregis). The First Vatican Council in 1870 also marked the beginning of significant internal changes in the Church that would later find their fulfillment with the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s.

The collection also chronicles the Protestant Reformation with biographies of leading figures such as Jan Huss, Martin Luther, John Calvin, and Philipp Melanchthon. The story of the 19th century is also told through the lives of leading thinkers such as theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher, theologian and historian Adolf von Harnack, preacher Dwight Moody, philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, and Ralph Waldo Emerson. While English is the predominant language in the collection, eighteen other languages from German and French to Russian and Japanese are also represented. To learn more about 19th century social movements, please see the collection Religion and Social Change, 1723-1921.</shortDescription>

They are designed to be actionable and to inform decision making at the point of care. Each Cochrane Clinical Answer contains a clinical question, a short answer, and an opportunity to 'drill down' to the evidence from relevant Cochrane reviews. The evidence is displayed in a user friendly format, mixing narrative, numbers and graphics. The target audience for Cochrane Clinical Answers is healthcare practitioners and professionals, and other informed health care decision-makers. Cochrane Clinical Answers have been developed by Cochrane Innovations Ltd. and Wiley Online Library.</shortDescription>

        <caption>Cairn.info International Edition</caption>
        <shortDescription>Carin.info was created in September 2005 by four Belgian and French publishers. Today Cairn offers the most comprehensive collection of publications in the French language in the humanities and social sciences available online. Since 2014, Carin expanded their collection to include around 400 journals and more than 2,000 eBooks from major French, Belgian and Swiss publishers on the same platform, www.cairn.info. Students, scholars and librarians all over the world will thus be able to access more than 2,000 full-text articles and book chapters online. Cairn continues to add new resources to their online platform. To make this invaluable content accessible to a non-francophone readership, Cairn.info launched Cairn International Edition, an English-language platform where abstracts and selected articles from key journals on Cairn.info are translated from French into English, enabling users to search, browse and read this content without speaking a word of French.

We collect serial publications from established platforms and primary source material from artists, authors, designers and cultural thinkers, often including overlooked media such as typefaces, podcasts, 3D models, field recordings and software. Many such independently produced digital art publications are not being archived and are at risk of being lost from the historical record. Library Stack preserves and indexes all works according to Open Archives standards, and exposes them to the global library system through the WorldCat database.</shortDescription>

        <caption>Archives Unbound</caption>
        <shortDescription>Archives Unbound presents topically-focused digital collections of historical documents that support the research and study needs of scholars, researchers, and students at the college and university level and beyond. As a multi-disciplinary resource, the greatest value of Archives Unbound lies in the wealth of facts and insights that the collections provide in connection with political and military, economic and business, literary, music, and social history of the United States and many other countries. From many perspectives Archives Unbound illuminates such events and developments as the Industrial Revolution and its attendant negatives and benefits; the rise and fall of nations in the 19th and 20th centuries; the development of social movements, such as the women's right to vote or the right to birth control; the various faces and responses to the end of colonialism; the economic and social stratification of America; and the resurgence of Western Europe following the devastation and economic collapse of the post-World War II period. Since its inception in 2009 the Archives Unbound program has published more than 230 titles. The roots of the program are in microfilm, and the collection makes available targeted collections of interest to scholars engaged in serious research. Particular strengths in the Archive Unbound catalog include U.S. foreign policy; U.S. civil rights; global affairs and colonial studies; and modern history. Broad topic clusters include: African American studies; American Indian studies; Asian studies; British history; Holocaust studies; LGBT studies; Latin American and Caribbean studies; Middle East studies; political science; religious studies; and women's studies. The Archives Unbound program consists of more than 290,000 documents totaling 12 million pages. Individual titles in the collection range between 1,200 and 200,000 pages. Over the coming year we will add 32 new collections amounting to more than 1.1 million pages.</shortDescription>

In addition, the North Rhine-Westphalian bibliography and all journals in the journal database (ZDB) are integrated in the hbz association catalog. The stocks actively contributed by the network libraries and their assigned institutions form the basis for online interlibrary loan. The hbz association catalog is supplemented by the inventory of a large number of public and other libraries that automatically deliver their inventory to the hbz. The union catalog has a volume of around 20 million title data records plus inventory information.</shortDescription>

        <caption>SCOAP3</caption>
        <shortDescription>SCOAP3 is a one-of-its-kind partnership of over three thousand libraries, key funding agencies and research centers in 44 countries and 3 intergovernmental organisations. Working with leading publishers, SCOAP3 has converted key journals in the field of High-Energy Physics to Open Access at no cost for authors. SCOAP3 centrally pays publishers for costs involved in providing Open Access, publishers, in turn, reduce subscription fees to all their customers, who can re-direct these funds to contribute to SCOAP3. Each country contributes in a way commensurate to its scientific output in the field. In addition, existing Open Access journals are also centrally supported, removing any existing financial barrier for authors. SCOAP3 journals are open for any scientist to publish in without any financial barriers. Copyright stays with authors, and a permissive CC-BY license allows text- and data-mining. SCOAP3 addresses Open Access mandates at no burden for authors. All articles appear in the SCOAP3 repository for further distribution, as well as being Open Access on publishers' websites.</shortDescription>

        <caption>Directory of Open Access Books</caption>
        <shortDescription>The primary aim of DOAB is to increase discoverability of Open Access books. Academic publishers are invited to provide metadata of their Open Access books to DOAB. Metadata will be harvestable in order to maximize dissemination, visibility and impact. Aggregators can integrate the records in their commercial services and libraries can integrate the directory into their online catalogues, helping scholars and students to discover the books. The directory is open to all publishers who publish academic, peer reviewed books in Open Access and should contain as many books as possible, provided that these publications are in Open Access and meet academic standards.</shortDescription>

        <shortDescription>Aozora Bunko is an activity to collect free electronic books with &amp;lt;Aozora&amp;gt;, which can be accessed by anyone with the Internet, as one public book rack. On this open air shelf, volunteers can freely read, handle, and start new works and services. It is a database that contains works and novels which are either public domain or licensed by the authors. Thus there aren’t any journals. The Aozora Bunko contains two types of works, one whose copyright has disappeared 50 years after the author's death , and the other, which the copyright holder has decided that "it is okay to read it through the Internet."</shortDescription>

        <caption>Descriptions of Fungi and Bacteria</caption>
        <shortDescription>The Descriptions of Fungi and Bacteria are designed for use by plant pathologists and veterinary and medical mycologists. They provide integrated information to allow identification/confirmation of identity of significant species, along with related information on pathology or other economic significance. Key facts Diagnostic descriptions, illustrations and information on over 2100 fungal and bacterial taxa Fully searchable via a subset of CAB Abstracts Now available electronically Includes a complete electronic backfile to 1964 Produced by experts in mycology and bacteriology Many of the illustrations are unique to DFB - many of the species are not adequately illustrated anywhere else. Descriptions of Fungi and Bacteria are produced by CABI Microbial Services (which includes the organization formerly known as the International Mycological Institute (IMI)) the pre-eminent global taxonomy/information provider on fungi). Each sheet is written by an authority on that particular organism. Because of this expert authorship Descriptions of Fungi and Bacteria are widely regarded as official definitions of the species concerned. Many of the pictures / drawings are unique to the series and a substantial number of species are not adequately illustrated elsewhere. CABI has published Descriptions of Fungi and Bacteria since 1964. The backfile, available in electronic format since 2006, includes diagnostic descriptions and background biological information on over 2100 species of fungi and bacteria, including many of the most economically important taxa. https://www.cabi.org/dfb/about/</shortDescription>

        <caption>Distribution Maps of Plant Pests</caption>
        <shortDescription>The need for accurate distribution data for plant pests is so important. Distribution Maps of Plant Pests, first published in 1951, are a respected, referenced source of such data, expertly compiled, validated and used by plant health organizations around the world. The maps provide an essential complement to expanding knowledge on plant pest distribution. Distribution Maps of Plant Pests continue to be the most authoritative source of information on the presence and extent of specific plant pests. About the Plant Pest Maps Distribution Maps of Plant Pests cover important arthropod pests affecting agriculture, horticulture and forestry. Two sets of maps are produced each year, comprising mostly of new maps with a number of map revisions (where significant changes have merited a revision). There are nine pests per map set. By the end of 2018 the total number of different species mapped in the series was over 820. These figures do not include new editions, and many maps have been revised following changes to taxonomy or distribution, some a number of times. This site contains the complete archive of the Distribution Maps as well as the very latest publications. The maps can be searched by preferred scientific name, or synonyms, and browsed by taxonomic group or by year. Typing ‘yr:2018’ in the search box will return all maps published in 2018. A faceted search may be used to generate lists of maps, e.g. of pests which attack a particular host, or maps published in a particular year. The maps are available in pdf format and are designed to print out on either A4 or US legal sized paper (enable printer scaling for best results).</shortDescription>

        <caption>CAB eBooks</caption>
        <shortDescription>CAB eBooks provides online access to broad, authoritative knowledge from a leading scientific publisher. Titles are indexed and retrievable as chapters, ensuring that a search of available titles returns the most relevant results. - Easy-to-use PDF eBooks - Search keywords or browse by subject - Discover content written by world experts, chapter by chapter - Anytime/anywhere unlimited access - Permissive DRM: no limits to concurrent users, downloads, printing, sharing or interlibrary loan. - COUNTER4-compliant usage statistics - Downloadable MARC records - CAB eBooks operates alongside CAB Abstracts - CABI's leading abstracts database - providing rich indexing and search tools CAB eBooks Packages There are three multi-subject packages that contain all CABI eBooks published within a date range, comprising a Front File subscription package and fixed packages for outright purchase. CAB eBooks Front File (2014-present) The CAB eBooks Front File is a dynamic subscription product that grows as newly published books are added. There are currently over 170 books in this collection (over 3,000 chapters) (as of November 2018). The front file contains all eBooks published from 2014 onwards, with 40-50 new titles added each year. The CAB eBooks Front File is available under CABI’s innovative lease-purchase model. Under this model, customers who lease the front file every year are given perpetual access to the content at no extra cost as soon as it becomes available for ownership. CAB eBooks (2007-2013) 317 titles (6,200 chapters), available for one-off purchase with perpetual ownership. CAB eBooks (2000-2006) 337 titles (6,300 chapters), available for one-off purchase with perpetual ownership. We would like to include all of the CAB eBooks in EDS. They are all indexed in CAB Abstracts, so the metadata would be very familiar to EBSCO. (Sample review can be from CAB abstracts data).</shortDescription>

        <shortDescription>Africa Intelligence publishes daily exclusive information essential to understanding the local and regional challenges the continent faces today. Our publication chronicles the political, diplomatic and economic lives of the African states in detail. We look for the men and women working behind the scenes in these three fields, those pulling the strings outside of the official circuits, and decipher their relational circles. While Africa Intelligence covers all of the sectors strategic to the continent, we offer specialised reporting of the oil and gas and mining industries and focus on those with a growing pan-African impact: infrastructure and power, banking and finance, and security and defence matters.
